# thermal-power-plants-management-system

An academic work written in Language C to a subject from Software Engineering Degree at the University of Brasilia called Algoritimos e Programação de Computadores
(Algorithms and Computer Programming, which gives the freshmen an introduction to programming logic), that intends to be a prototype of a thermal power plants
management system where users can register power plants, consumers, and contracts, search for them and exclude any data if wanted.

Instructions of Use:
- The source code has some visual issues with some exceptions (not showing some data) but works exactly as was pretended for;
- I wrote the original code in Portuguese but I pretend to translate it asap and commit an English version of it;
- To use the program and make registrations the data entered should be valid (consumer ID, date, power plant CNPJ, etc), you can generate it at https://www.4devs.com.br/;
- Any doubts? Contact me!
